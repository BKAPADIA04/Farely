# Farely: A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Uber Fares

- This project aims to predict Uber's fare prices for future transactions. With millions of daily customers, effective data management is crucial for strategy and operations. Accurate fare estimation supports customer satisfaction and pricing efficiency. By using various machine learning models, the project seeks to improve prediction accuracy and offer valuable insights for business planning.

- This project utilizes various machine learning models to predict Uber fare prices for future transactions, aiming to boost accuracy and provide actionable business insights. The implemented regression techniques include linear regression, polynomial linear regression, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regressor, support vector machines regressor, and linear regression models with regularization. Additionally, ensemble methods were explored, with the Gradient Boosting ensemble technique achieving the highest RÂ² score of 0.734. This analysis not only enhances fare prediction precision but also offers valuable data-driven recommendations for optimizing pricing strategies and improving the customer experience.
